# cryptography
This repo contains some basic encryption/decryption codes for certain cryptography methods.

Initially I will upload two files for plain text encryption:-

1. Vignere cipher
2. Vernam cipher

The instructions to use these files have been written in their respective .py code files. It is simple code and does not check for false paramenters so kindly make sure you enter inputs correctly.

I have tried to code them in as little time complexity and in a clean and efficient way that is easy to understand.

Furthermore, I have uploaded the following files:-

(ciphers)
3. Caesar
4. Playfair
5. Hill
6. Rail fence
7. Fiestal
8. RSA
9. ElGamal (cryptosystem)

(key encryption)
10. RSA
11. Diffie-Hellman

Hopefully, these code files will help you understand how plain text is encrypted and how secret keys are generated and will provide an insight onto Informational Security or Cryptography.
