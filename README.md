# cryptography
This repo contains some basic encryption/decryption codes for certain cryptography methods.

Initially I will upload two files

1. Vignere cipher
2. Vernam cipher
The instructions to use these files have been written in their respective .py code files. It is simple code and does not check for false paramenters so kindly make sure you enter inputs correctly.

I have tried to code them in as little time complexity and in a clean and efficient way that is easy to understand.
